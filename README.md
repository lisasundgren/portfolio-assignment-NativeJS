Pages I got my inspiration from:

1. https://www.behindthebarwithcaradevine.com/
2. https://www.holycityhandcraft.com/
3. https://www.systembolaget.se/

The Logo is created with AI.

All other images came from the cocktail-API.

Things I'd like to implement in the future:

- delete names from the list in Favourites (and in LocalStorage)
- create a better array in localStorage with more collected data
- save based on ID instead and delete based on it as well
